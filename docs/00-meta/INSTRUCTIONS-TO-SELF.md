# Instructions to Self

## Purpose of This Repo

This is a **capability lab**, not a tutorial. It documents real security work building SOC analyst expertise through hands-on practice. The portfolio demonstrates:
- Practical threat detection and analysis work
- Decision-making in alert tuning and rule development
- Technical writing based on actual lab experience

## How I Work with Claude

I use Claude Code as my primary engineering/scripting agent. Claude handles:
- Setting up directory structures and automation
- Writing and refining scripts
- Compiling research into structured documents
- Helping frame blog posts from lab work

I use a separate Claude instance for deep research, analysis, and writing feedback.

All script additions go through Sourcery AI code review before committing.

## Weekly Workflow

1. **Plan** — Define what I'm testing/building this week
2. **Lab** — Capture screenshots, logs, configurations
3. **Log** — Write day-logs with what I did and what I learned
4. **Compile** — Summarize findings into docs/04-results/
5. **Write** — Draft blog post if milestone reached
6. **Review** — Share with Claude (research) for feedback
7. **Publish** — Finalize and post to Substack (if ready)

## What Constitutes "Done" for a Session

A lab session is complete when:
- [ ] I have a day-log entry (format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- [ ] Evidence is captured (logs, screenshots, configs)
- [ ] At least one new thing is documented in lessons-learned.md
- [ ] Metrics are updated if applicable
- [ ] Next steps are clear

If I'm writing a blog post that week, it's done when:
- [ ] First draft is in docs/05-blog-posts/draft-XXX.md
- [ ] Claude (research) has reviewed it
- [ ] Final edits are complete and it's ready for publishing
- [ ] It's moved to docs/05-blog-posts/published/
