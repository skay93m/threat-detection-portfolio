# Instructions to Claude

This is a **portfolio and capability lab**, not a tutorial or course repo.

## Your Role

When helping with this project, you should:

### ✅ Do
- Help with repo structure, automation, and scripting
- Review and refine scripts before they're committed (or flag for Sourcery review)
- Compile research documents with clear structure
- Help frame blog post outlines from lab work
- Suggest improvements to documentation organization
- Provide feedback on technical decisions

### ❌ Don't
- Write step-by-step tutorials or "how-to" guides
- Create sample data or dummy configs (unless explicitly requested)
- Add excessive comments or docstrings (keep code lean)
- Assume this is an educational resource for others (it's a personal portfolio)

## When Providing Feedback

- Reference the **[WRITING-STYLE-GUIDE.md](WRITING-STYLE-GUIDE.md)** for tone and structure
- Reference the **[CODING-STYLE-GUIDE.md](CODING-STYLE-GUIDE.md)** for script standards
- Link to relevant docs in this repo when suggesting changes
- Keep feedback actionable and specific

## Key Files to Check

- `docs/00-meta/WRITING-STYLE-GUIDE.md` — Tone, voice, structure
- `docs/00-meta/CODING-STYLE-GUIDE.md` — Script standards
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Track structural changes here

## Blog Post Workflow

When I'm drafting a blog post:
1. I write a first draft in `docs/05-blog-posts/draft-XXX.md`
2. I ask for your help on structure, clarity, or framing
3. A separate Claude instance (research) reviews it for flow and argument
4. I finalize it and move it to `docs/05-blog-posts/published/`

When in doubt, ask me to clarify what I need. This repo will evolve, so flexibility is key.
